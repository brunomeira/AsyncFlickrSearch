AsyncFlickrSearch
=================

This is a small project which is basically a search box that looks for images on flickr.
Also, it was added a on demand pagination. Everytime that the scroll touches the bottom the application will look for 10 more images.
In this project I'm using:
- tableless concepts
- Rails 3.2
- Flickraw
- JQUery

Some Images:
![Initial Screen](/brunomeira/AsyncFlickrSearch/blob/master/img/img1.jpg)
![First Retrieve](/brunomeira/AsyncFlickrSearch/blob/master/img/img2.jpg)
![Scrolling down retrieves more images](/brunomeira/AsyncFlickrSearch/blob/master/img/img3.jpg)
![New images retrieved](/brunomeira/AsyncFlickrSearch/blob/master/img/img4.jpg)

Take a look at my website. Im developing it, but most of features are already working.
the site is: www.developingsoftwares.com
